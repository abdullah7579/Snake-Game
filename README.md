An engaging object-oriented programming project implementing the classic Snake Game. 

Key features include:
Object-Oriented Design: Classes and objects for structured code.
File Handling: High scores stored using <fstream>.
Dynamic Memory Allocation: Snake body coordinates managed with dynamic arrays.
Game Mechanics: Handles collision detection, snake growth, and game-over conditions.
User Interaction: Keyboard controls for snake movement.
Randomization: Random fruit positioning.
High Score Tracking: Persistent high scores stored in a file.
This project demonstrates core OOP principles, dynamic memory usage, and game development fundamentals.
